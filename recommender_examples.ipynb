    "The recommender.py module contains the artist class. The artist class has two functions; the scrape function that scrapes the LastFM webpages to retrieve any missing artists tags and also the recommender engine itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "The recommender engine uses simple cosine similarity to make recommendations from two utility matrices. The first is the user-artist utility matrix which contains binary data. Has a user listened to an artist in the catalogue or not. The second matrix is more of an item-item utility matrix. Here I attempted to extract information for each artist in terms of how often they were tagged, how frequently they were listened to an also what type of music does the artist play. The data will be biased in terms of collectively how often the artist was tagged or listened to and this will influence the recommendations from this matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally the data is very sparse. There are over 17,000 artists and over 8000 users but the amount of artists listened to or tagged by the user population is relatively low. With the sparsity as it is the test is more akin to a cold start.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both functions are called below."
