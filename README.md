 
There are two data sets in the repo. The raw zipfile and also a dataframe containing scraped artist tags from the LastFM webpages. Both sets of data are used in the recommendation engine.

The artist class contains the main recommendation engine function along with the scraping function. That artist class is contained within the recommendation.py module.

The recommender_examples.ipynb notebook is included to illustrate the various functions at work.
