 
There are two data sets in the repo. The raw zipfile and also a dataframe containing scraped artist tags from LastFM URL's. Both sets of data are
used in the recommendation engine.

The main recommondation engine function along with the scraping function are contained in the artist class. That artist class is contained within the recommendation.py module.

Some examples of the functions in action are contained within the recommender_examples.ipynb notebook.
